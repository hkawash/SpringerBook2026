  abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of inferring sparse causal networks modeled by multivariate auto-regressive (MAR) processes. Conditions are derived under which the Group Lasso (gLasso) procedure consistently estimates sparse network structure. The key condition involves a ``false connection score'' {$\psi$}. In particular, we show that consistent recovery is possible even when the number of observations of the network is far less than the number of parameters describing the network, provided that {$\psi$} {$<$} 1. The false connection score is also demonstrated to be a useful metric of recovery in non-asymptotic regimes. The conditions suggest a modified gLasso procedure which tends to improve the false connection score and reduce the chances of reversing the direction of causal influence. Computational experiments and a real network based electrocorticogram (ECoG) simulation study demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.},

However, in many cases, few individuals have pertinent information, such as knowledge about the location of a food source, or of a migration route. Using a simple model we show how information can be transferred within groups both without signalling and when group members do not know which individuals, if any, have information. We reveal that the larger the group the smaller the proportion of informed individuals needed to guide the group, and that only a very small proportion of informed individuals is required to achieve great accuracy. We also demonstrate how groups can make consensus decisions, even though informed individuals do not know whether they are in a majority or minority, how the quality of their information compares with that of others, or even whether there are any other informed individuals. Our model provides new insights into the mechanisms of effective leadership and decision-making in biological systems.},

The model is then used to show how differences among individuals influence group structure, and how individuals employing simple, local rules of thumb, can accurately change their spatial position within a group (e.g. to move to the centre, the front, or the periphery) in the absence of information on their current position within the group as a whole.

This reveals how the external visual information available to each group member depends on the number of individuals in the group, the position within the group, and the location of the external visually detectable stimulus. We find that in small groups, individuals have detection capability in nearly all directions, while in large groups, occlusion by neighbours causes detection capability to vary with position within the group. To understand the principles that drive detection in groups, we formulate a simple, and generally applicable, model that captures how visual detection properties emerge due to geometric scaling of the space occupied by the group and occlusion caused by neighbours.We employ these insights to discuss principles that extend beyond our specific system, such as how collective detection depends on individual body shape, and the size and structure of the group.},

These two notions both rely on the assumption that the user can exert control over select leader agents, and we contrast this with another approach whereby the agents are modeled as particles suspended in a fluid, which can be ``stirred'' by the operator. The theoretical developments are coupled with multirobot experiments and human user-studies to support the practical viability and feasibility of the proposed methods.},

  abstract = {Extracting the interaction rules of biological agents from movement sequences pose challenges in various domains. Granger causality is a practical framework for analyzing the interactions from observed time-series data; however, this framework ignores the structures and assumptions of the generative process in animal behaviors, which may lead to interpretational problems and sometimes erroneous assessments of causality. In this paper, we propose a new framework for learning Granger causality from multi-animal trajectories via augmented theory-based behavioral models with interpretable data-driven models. We adopt an approach for augmenting incomplete multi-agent behavioral models described by time-varying dynamical systems with neural networks. For efficient and interpretable learning, our model leverages theory-based architectures separating navigation and motion processes, and the theory-guided regularization for reliable behavioral modeling. This can provide interpretable signs of Granger-causal effects over time, i.e., when specific others cause the approach or separation. In experiments using synthetic datasets, our method achieved better performance than various baselines. We then analyzed multi-animal datasets of mice, flies, birds, and bats, which verified our method and obtained novel biological insights.},

Effectiveness is interpreted to characterize how the movements of the leader nodes translate into responses among the remaining follower nodes. This notion of effectiveness is a function of the interaction topologies, the agent configurations, and the particular choice of inputs used to influence the network. In fact, classic manipulability is an index used in robotics to analyze the singularity and efficiency of configurations of robot-arm manipulators. To define similar notions for leader\textendash follower networks, we use a rigid-link approximation of the follower dynamics and, under this assumption, we prove that the instantaneous follower velocities can be uniquely determined from that of the leaders', which allows us to define a meaningful and computable manipulability index for the leader\textendash follower networks. This paper examines the property of the proposed index in simulation and with real mobile robots, and demonstrates how the index can be used to find effective interaction topologies.},

Experiments are conducted in a three-chambered instrumented water tank where a robotic-fish is juxtaposed with an empty compartment, and the preference of live subjects is scored as the mean time spent in the vicinity of the tank's two lateral sides. The tail-beating of the robotic-fish is controlled in real-time based on feedback from fish motion to explore a spectrum of closed-loop systems, including proportional and integral controllers. Closed-loop control systems are complemented by open-loop strategies, wherein the tail-beat of the robotic-fish is independent of the fish motion. The preference space and the locomotory patterns of fish for each experimental condition are analysed and compared to understand the influence of real-time closed-loop control on zebrafish response. The results of this study show that zebrafish respond differently to the pattern of tail-beating motion executed by the robotic-fish. Specifically, the preference and behaviour of zebrafish depend on whether the robotic-fish tail-beating frequency is controlled as a function of fish motion and how such closed-loop control is implemented.},

We apply these tools to several real networks, finding that the number of driver nodes is determined mainly by the network's degree distribution. We show that sparse inhomogeneous networks, which emerge in many real complex systems, are the most difficult to control, but that dense and homogeneous networks can be controlled using a few driver nodes. Counterintuitively, we find that in both model and real systems the driver nodes tend to avoid the high-degree nodes.},

To address this we developed bio-mimetic fish-like robots which allow us to measure directly the energy consumption associated with swimming together in pairs (the most common natural configuration in schooling fish). We find that followers, in any relative position to a near-neighbour, could obtain hydrodynamic benefits if they exhibit a tailbeat phase difference that varies linearly with front-back distance, a strategy we term `vortex phase matching'. Experiments with pairs of freely-swimming fish reveal that followers exhibit this strategy, and that doing so requires neither a functioning visual nor lateral line system. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that fish typically, but not exclusively, use vortex phase matching to save energy.},

This framework is more interpretable than other neural-network-based techniques for inferring Granger causality, since in addition to relational inference, it also allows detecting signs of Granger-causal effects and inspecting their variability over time. In comprehensive experiments on simulated data, we show that our framework performs on par with several powerful baseline methods at inferring Granger causality and that it achieves better performance at inferring interaction signs. The results suggest that our framework is a viable and more interpretable alternative to sparse-input neural networks for inferring Granger causality.},

We consider contagions propagating over the edges of an unobserved social network, where we only observe the times when nodes became infected, but not who infected them. Given such node infection times, we then identify the optimal network that best explains the observed data. We present a maximum likelihood approach based on convex programming with a l1-like penalty term that encourages sparsity. Experiments on real and synthetic data reveal that our method near-perfectly recovers the underlying network structure as well as the parameters of the contagion propagation model. Moreover, our approach scales well as it can infer optimal networks of thousands of nodes in a matter of minutes.},

Whereas specific features of aggregations are often visually striking to human eyes, a heuristic analysis based on human vision is usually not sufficient to answer fundamental questions about how and why organisms aggregate. What are the individual-level behavioral traits that give rise to these features? When qualitatively similar spatial patterns arise from purely physical mechanisms, are these patterns in organisms biologically significant, or are they simply epiphenomena that are likely characteristics of any set of interacting autonomous individuals? If specific features of spatial aggregations do confer advantages or disadvantages in the fitness of group members, how has evolution operated to shape individual behavior in balancing costs and benefits at the individual and group levels? Mathematical models of social behaviors such as schooling in fishes provide a promising avenue to address some of these questions. However, the literature on schooling models has lacked a common framework to objectively and quantitatively characterize relationships between individual-level behaviors and group-level patterns. In this paper, we briefly survey similarities and differences in behavioral algorithms and aggregation statistics among existing schooling models. We present preliminary results of our efforts to develop a modeling framework that synthesizes much of this previous work, and to identify relationships between behavioral parameters and group-level statistics.},

  abstract = {In this work, we consider the controlled agreement problem for multi-agent networks, where a collection of agents take on leader roles while the remaining agents execute local, consensus-like protocols. Our aim is to identify reflections of graph-theoretic notions on systemtheoretic properties of such systems. In particular, we show how the symmetry structure of the network, characterized in terms of its automorphism group, directly relates to the controllability of the corresponding multi-agent system. Moreover, we introduce network equitable partitions as a means by which such controllability characterizations can be extended to the multileader setting.},

  abstract = {Significance             We know little about the nature of the evolved interaction networks that give rise to the rapid coordinated collective response exhibited by many group-living organisms. Here, we study collective evasion in schooling fish using computational techniques to reconstruct the scene from the perspective of the organisms themselves. This method allows us to establish how the complex social scene is translated into behavioral response at the level of individuals and to visualize, and analyze, the resulting complex communication network as behavioral change spreads rapidly through groups. Thus, we can map, for any moment in time, the extent to which each individual is socially influential during collective evasion and predict the magnitude of such behavioral epidemics before they actually occur.           ,                             Coordination among social animals requires rapid and efficient transfer of information among individuals, which may depend crucially on the underlying structure of the communication network. Establishing the decision-making circuits and networks that give rise to individual behavior has been a central goal of neuroscience. However, the analogous problem of determining the structure of the communication network among organisms that gives rise to coordinated collective behavior, such as is exhibited by schooling fish and flocking birds, has remained almost entirely neglected. Here, we study collective evasion maneuvers, manifested through rapid waves, or cascades, of behavioral change (a ubiquitous behavior among taxa) in schooling fish (               Notemigonus crysoleucas               ). We automatically track the positions and body postures, calculate visual fields of all individuals in schools of {$\sim$}150 fish, and determine the functional mapping between socially generated sensory input and motor response during collective evasion. We find that individuals use simple, robust measures to assess behavioral changes in neighbors, and that the resulting networks by which behavior propagates throughout groups are complex, being weighted, directed, and heterogeneous. By studying these interaction networks, we reveal the (complex, fractional) nature of social contagion and establish that individuals with relatively few, but strongly connected, neighbors are both most socially influential and most susceptible to social influence. Furthermore, we demonstrate that we can predict complex cascades of behavioral change at their moment of initiation, before they actually occur. Consequently, despite the intrinsic stochasticity of individual behavior, establishing the hidden communication networks in large self-organized groups facilitates a quantitative understanding of behavioral contagion.},

  abstract = {We review the observations and the basic laws describing the essential aspects of collective motion - being one of the most common and spectacular manifestation of coordinated behavior. Our aim is to provide a balanced discussion of the various facets of this highly multidisciplinary field, including experiments, mathematical methods and models for simulations, so that readers with a variety of background could get both the basics and a broader, more detailed picture of the field. The observations we report on include systems consisting of units ranging from macromolecules through metallic rods and robots to groups of animals and people. Some emphasis is put on models that are simple and realistic enough to reproduce the numerous related observations and are useful for developing concepts for a better understanding of the complexity of systems consisting of many simultaneously moving entities. As such, these models allow the establishing of a few fundamental principles of flocking. In particular, it is demonstrated, that in spite of considerable differences, a number of deep analogies exist between equilibrium statistical physics systems and those made of self-propelled (in most cases living) units. In both cases only a few well defined macroscopic/collective states occur and the transitions between these states follow a similar scenario, involving discontinuity and algebraic divergences. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

In our model particles are driven with a constant absolute velocity and at each time step assume the average direction of motion of the particles in their neighborhood with some random perturbation ({$\eta$}) added. We present numerical evidence that this model results in a kinetic phase transition from no transport (zero average velocity, |va| = 0) to finite net transport through spontaneous symmetry breaking of the rotational symmetry. The transition is continuous since |va| is found to scale as ({$\eta$}c - {$\eta$}){$\beta$} with {$\beta$} {$\simeq$} 0.45.},

  abstract = {In moving animal groups, social interactions play a key role in the ability of individuals to achieve coordinated motion. However, a large number of environmental and cognitive factors are able to modulate the expression of these interactions and the characteristics of the collective movements that result from these interactions. Here, we use a data-driven fish school model to quantitatively investigate the impact of perceptual and cognitive factors on coordination and collective swimming patterns. The model describes the interactions involved in the coordination of burst-and-coast swimming in groups of               Hemigrammus rhodostomus               . We perform a comprehensive investigation of the respective impacts of two interactions strategies between fish based on the selection of the most or the two most influential neighbors, of the range and intensity of social interactions, of the intensity of individual random behavioral fluctuations, and of the group size, on the ability of groups of fish to coordinate their movements. We find that fish are able to coordinate their movements when they interact with their most or two most influential neighbors, provided that a minimal level of attraction between fish exist to maintain group cohesion. A minimal level of alignment is also required to allow the formation of schooling and milling. However, increasing the strength of social interactions does not necessarily enhance group cohesion and coordination. When attraction and alignment strengths are too high, or when the heading random fluctuations are too large, schooling and milling can no longer be maintained and the school switches to a swarming phase. Increasing the interaction range between fish has a similar impact on collective dynamics as increasing the strengths of attraction and alignment. Finally, we find that coordination and schooling occurs for a wider range of attraction and alignment strength in small group sizes.},
